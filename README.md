### How we work at CivicDataLab

#### What is our working model
Working model is a frame-work to standardise some of the decisions we take at CDL. It covers most of our processes related to hiring, sharing feedback with people, how we learn and acquire new skills, how we manage our projects, etc. According to us, this is a dynamic document and will always be. Existing ideas will be updated, new ideas will be added and in the process we would like to share our learnings with the community, which is why we decided to keep this process as open and democratic as possible. 

#### Why is it important to define it and standardise few processes
To take decisions in a smaller team is easy, but as the team grows, it takes time and effort to make sure that all members are on the same page when taking their project or team level decisions. Our's being a remote team adds further to this complexity in terms of communications. Creating a working model, not only helps us with our comms but also encourages the team to question and challenge parts of it and share their ideas whereever required. 

#### How to add new questions (if your concern is not addressed yet)
- Each question is just an open issue with relevant tags
- Please refer to the [issue template](issue_template.md) when adding new questions
- Make sure to be as descriptive as possible, as that will help the team to understand it better and take actions quickly
- Don't forget to rank your question/issues from 1(not so important) to 5 (most important) to help us plan our milestones better

#### Process to define parts of the working model
- [ScrumJi](https://medium.com/civicdatalab/the-scrumji-experiment-44b25fe60b55) for the month will be responsible for maintaining monthly milestones
- Open issues will be added to the milestone every month as per their priority order
- ScrumJi will be responsible to schedule discussions throughout the month to take care of these issues and try to close them as soon as possible
- Remember, Less-is-better, it's great even if we're able to close one issue a month.
- and also remember, We won't always have answers to write. It's fine, we learn as we go.
