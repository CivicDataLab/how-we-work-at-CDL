**Description** : Desribe your issue/question in detail. 

**Why should this be part of the working model** : Why do you think, this question should be part of the working model. Yes, a working model takes care of a lot of things, but somethings things are defined within a context and are one-of situations. Try consulting a team-member before if you have any doubts on whether something should be part of the working model document. 

**On a scale of 1(low priority) to 5 (high priority), how concerning is this to you** : This is an important question and will decide whether the issues will be addressed by the ScrumJi for the month. Please think before you rate. Do have a look at other open issues as well and rate accordingly,  you can definitely update your rating later, but rate accordingly, if you feel that other open issues are more important to be discussed at that momemt

**In absence of a standard procedure, can you share some instances where you took a decision and how** : This description will help the team relate to the context, your experience and whether major changes are required at this point. Share examples from your experience, past work commitments, etc, that can help the team decide your issues as soon as possible. These are probable ideas which might be added to our working model, so be a bit descriptive and try to think from a process view point.
